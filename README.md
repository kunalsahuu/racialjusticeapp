## **What is Open Sentencing?**
People in the Black Community are faced with harsher downstream effects (charged at higher rates, assigned more significant charges, convicted at higher rates, given longer sentences, and denied parole more often) than people of other races for similar offenses. This systemic bias in the justice system has a profound and lasting impact on black families, communities and the country. The Open Sentencing solution starter helps expose bias and empowers public defenders  to address racial disparities in the judicial system directly. Our solution includes an engaging user interface (UI) that feeds into our pre-trained Bias & Disparity Detection Engine. This innovative engine analyzes fact patterns and rapidly provides statistical analysis that highlights deviations from guidelines by race throughout an accused person's judiciary process.  The reports from Open Sentencing solution starter provides clear insights for the public defender to aid in defending against detected bias, ultimately & ideally fairly reducing incarceration for members of the black community.

We created a tool with the goal of ***reducing sentencing*** for people impacted by **bias** and **racism**.

A Web application where a defense attorney / public defender can upload information about a case and the defendant.

Analyzes available data
Provides public defense attorneys with insights, connections, and bias indicators for each case
Information and outcomes from this tool will be fed into a public site where anyone can see trends and request updates for bias in the criminal justice system
